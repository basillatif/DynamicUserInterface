| **Web Service Functions (_3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | 2 API calls seen; the review_counts call is implemented generally correctly but I should probably have been approached regarding the title call. Although the API response is nominally JSON, its content is actually a CSS/HTML fragment. Your need to write special parsing code is a signal that things aren’t quite how they should have been. I could have given you some advice on how to use this information more effectively (thus also improving what was seen in your web app layout). You weren’t expected to know what to do with this unconventional response immediately, but you should have recognized that this response significantly diverged from what was seen in class and therefore might have been worth asking about. | 35 | Missing 1 API call |
| **Web App Layout (_2b_, _3a_, _3b_, _4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | The web app layout is straightforward enough but after a little use, it turns out to be quite unfinished. The book title search yields only…a URL? Why just a URL as text? If you have a URL, why not make it a link? Upon further inspection, it looks like it is meant to belong in an `iframe`—why wasn’t it placed there? These might not have been specifically mentioned in class, but you _are_ allowed to look them up and I’m always available to answer questions. Just seems like there’s a lot of untapped potential here.<br><br>The review statistics function also has this unfinished-but-in-a-puzzling-way quality. The web app only displays the reviews count, despite there being way more counts available in the API response. The code shows that there was also an attempt to display `average_rating` but the use of the `text` function means that the reviews count immediately overwrote the average rating text. Why wasn’t this turned into a table instead? It feels like a very natural mapping to take each of these review statistics and turn them each into a row in a table.<br><br>It feels as if the work was concluded at the very moment _some_ kind of output showed up on the page. However, that is not the point of the assignment. The assignment is to make a small but fully functional modern web application—it is an interaction design exercise after all. So this means not only getting data to display in the web page, but also trying to get that data to appear in the best way possible so that it is most easily understood by the user. | 20 | Output on page is strikingly minimalist compared to the amount of information available from the web services used |
| **Test Suite (_4a_, _4b_, _4d_)** | 6 successes out of 6 tests<br><br>**Statements** 25/30 (83.33%)<br>**Branches** 1/2 (50.00%)<br>**Functions** 0/0 (100.00%)<br>**Lines** 24/28 (85.71%) | 18 | Generally great coverage, but the untouched code is the entire vertical functionality for review counts
| **Code Style (_4c_)** | no errors |  |  |
| **Version Control (_4e_)** | 9 commits—somewhat on the low side given the scale of the assignment | -1 |  |
| **Punctuality (_4f_)** | on time |  |  |
|  |  | **72** | **Total** |
